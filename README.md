# Prediction-and-Detection-of-Epileptic-Seizures
Epilepsy, Seizures, Neural Networks, EEG

In this project we pretend to build various models using Neural Networks in order to detect and/or predict epileptic seizures through an application.
Using EEG signals regists with 29 features were extracted and after the regists were labeled with the classes that corresponds to different brain states (interictal, ictal, pos-ictal, pre-ictal).
Neural Networks used: Long-Short Term Memory, Convolutional Networks, Shallow Networks.
Architectures: Feed Forward, Layer Recurrent.
Training functions: traingd, traingda, traingdm, trainlm, trainscg.
Metrics to evaluate the NN: precision, sensibility and specificity.

To use the application just run the MainGuide.m file where you can either train or test the different Neural Networks available.
